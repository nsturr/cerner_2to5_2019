# Cerner 2^5 2019 Programming Competition

This is my submissions for the Cerner 2^5 programming competition. Each day is
separated into individual folders (appropriately named). Each will use the words CSV
file stored in the 'words' directory.

I've been collecting words from various books, articles, etc over the years. This
collection will use that list for learning different languages.

Day 01 - Python Word Quiz
