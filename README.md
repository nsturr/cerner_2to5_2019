# Cerner 2^5 2019 Programming Competition

This is my submissions for the Cerner 2^5 programming competition. Each day is
separated into individual folders (appropriately named).

The theme is "Engineering Productivity" which, to me, can mean small programs that
help with productivity but it can also mean learning new languages which might lead
to productivity improvement (new tools means new opprotunities for finding the right
tool for the right problem).
