# Day 01 - Python Word Definition Quiz

Use the words.csv from the 'words' directory one above - generate a quiz question from four definitions.
Display the chosen word and all the definitions (sorted). The user must choose the correct answer.

This was run with Python3 ([3.6.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-369/) specifically)
from [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/index.html).

Example:
```
  C:\Workspace\cerner_2to5_2019\day01> python3.6m quiz.py
  pullulate:
      1. a nosy person; a busybody
      2. attach with slander; to sprinkle
      3. not agreeing with established beliefs or standards; unorthodox
      4. to breed, produce, or create rapidly
  Answer?
  4
  Correct!
```

Note: The user's input is not cleansed/verified so a non-numerical answer will result in an error.
