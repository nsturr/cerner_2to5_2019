# Day 08 - C++ Hexdump

I wrote this little C++ program to help where hexdump was not a long time ago. Now Cygwin
is available.  This was build with Visual Studio 12's command line builder.

Example:
```
  C:\Workspace\cerner_2to5_2019\day08> hexdump.exe small.file
       0:   H   e   l   l   o   ,       w   o   r   l   d   !  \r  \n  \r
      16:  \n
```
